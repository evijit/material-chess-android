#Material Chess - ChessTastic 

[Play Store Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nemesis.materialchess&hl=en)

An extension of the Dark Knight and Stockfish open source projects, I developed this as a hobby project last winter. I'm looking for a co-developer to help me maintain this project.

#Goals:

1. Move to Stockfish 6
2. Develop multiplayer using Play Games
3. Fix the bluetooth gaming functionality

Kindly send me pull requests and/or shoot a message at avijitg22@gmail.com if you are in or have improvements! Thank you.
